@section loggedou Logged-out user (Annotator mode)
By default every user is in "Annotator mode" where only limited features are visible. This mode is primarly for gathering user data in `Annotator` and `Ranker`. 

@section loggedin Logged-in user (Evaluator mode)
This mode is turned on after you switch to evaluator mode and provide the correct password (it is available in README.md file in the [repository](https://gitlab.mff.cuni.cz/mejzlikf/imagerankerapp)).

After that more pages become accessible - `Statistics` and `Model tester` alongside with some additional features - search progress bar on the `Ranker` page.
